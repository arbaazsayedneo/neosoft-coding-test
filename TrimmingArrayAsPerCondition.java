Given an integer array, trim it such that its maximum element becomes less than twice the minimum, return the minimum number of removals required for the conversion.
For example,
Input:  [4, 6, 1, 7, 5, 9, 2]
Output: The minimum number of removals is 4
The trimmed array is [7, 5, 9] where 9 < 2 × 5.


Input:  [4, 2, 6, 4, 9]
Output: The minimum number of removals is 3
The trimmed array is [6, 4] where 6 < 2 × 4.
